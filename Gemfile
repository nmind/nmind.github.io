# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!  Commenting out...
# gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.0"

# This was the default theme for new Jekyll sites. Changed to "minimal-mistakes-jekyll".
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll", "~> 4.24.0"
# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
gem "github-pages", "~> 218" , group: :jekyll_plugins
